	<h2>My 2021 holiday in Iceland &#127470;&#127480;</h2>
	<p class="pdate">August 2021</p>
	<section>
		<p>
			From the 29th of July till the 10th of August 2021, me, my girlfriend and our friend Thomas, were in Iceland for our summer holidays. In this small post I'll tell you about the things we did there and show some pictures of the incredible nature that you can find in Iceland.
			<br/>
			In the first leg of the holiday we hiked our way through Iceland over the Laugavegur trail and the Fimmv&#246;r&eth;uha&#769;ls trail, which are connected in the &THORN;o&#769;rsm&#246;rk area (which actually an area with a lot of trees, despite the urban myth that Iceland does not have trees). You can see the height map of the trails below.

			After completing the 6-day, 80 kilometer hike we ofcourse deserved some relaxing days in Reykjavi&#769;k, in which we discovered the cosy city, visited the Blue Lagoon and the currently erupting vulcano.

		<h3>Hiking the Laugavegur and Fimmv&#246;r&eth;uha&#769;ls trails</h3>
		<p>
			On July 29, we landed in the evening in Reykjavi&#769;k and put up our tents on the <a href="https://www.reykjavikcampsite.is">Reykjavik Campsite</a>. At the dawn of the next day, we took the bus to the first hut, Landmannalaugar. Despite the fact that we easily could start the hike, we camped here for a day, which allowed for an impressive evening walk on a <em>green-ish</em> mountain. My iPhone camera did not really capture the color as it actually was. It was so incredibly green/turquoise, very remarkable!

			On top of the green ridge we had a marvelous view over a lava field that we would pass through the next day, during our first official hiking day. Even though we did not even start the trail yet, we already had a great time!
		</p>
		<h4>Landmannalaugar &rarr; Hrafntinnusker (~12 km)</h4>
		<p>
			This was the first day of the 80km trail that would take us eventually to Sko&#769;gar. It started with a path through the impressive lava field we overlooked the evening before, and we quickly walked into the so-called rainbow mountains or rhyolite mountains. Since Iceland is basically one big vulcano, walked through a lot of active geothermal areas, accompanied by the stinging rotten-egg smell (sulphur) that was hissing, boiling and smoking out of the ground.

	  	As we climbed higher, the rhyolite mountains were left behind and the scenery went from colorful to grayscale. We walked across snowfields that were resting on black, vulcanic rock. The fog, which was getting thicker the higher we came, made this part of the trail kind of desolate, which actually contributed to the diversity of the (holi)day. When we arrived at the Hrafntinnusker hut, the fog was so thick, we could not even see the campsite, which was about 50m away from the hut!

	  	After setting up our tents and having some dinner, we wanted to do an evening hike (as if we didn't hike enough...). Some enthousiastic Americans told us to visit the ice caves, which was only a 1 hour hike from the hut and super cool. So, with the fog still thick (visibility of about ~20-30m), we started the trail to the ice caves. After a while, we came to a snowfield with a slight gradient down and this would be the correct way to the ice caves. We didn't see anything else but snow, but we thought; "Ah, we can only see for about 30m, so there will be a marking pole after about 60m or so", hence we started decending the snowfield. After 5 minutes, nothing but snow, after 10, 15, 20 minutes, nothing but snow and fog around us. We only knew what was up and down! After rethinking all the bad things we did in our lives, we finally saw "land", and soon after the impressive ice caves. It was a nice evening hike, but a bit scary as well!
