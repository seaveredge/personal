	<h2>My 2021 holiday in Iceland &#127470;&#127480;</h2>
	<p class="pdate">August 2021</p>
	<section>
		<p>
			From the 29th of July till the 10th of August 2021, me, my girlfriend and our friend Thomas, were in Iceland for our summer holidays. In this small post I'll tell you about the things we did there and show some pictures of the incredible nature that you can find in Iceland.
			<br/>
			In the first leg of the holiday we hiked our way through Iceland over the Laugavegur trail and the Fimmv&#246;r&eth;uha&#769;ls trail, which are connected in the &THORN;o&#769;rsm&#246;rk area (which actually an area with a lot of trees, despite the urban myth that Iceland does not have trees). You can see the height map of the trails below.

			</figure>
			After completing the 6-day, 80 kilometer hike we ofcourse deserved some relaxing days in Reykjavi&#769;k, in which we discovered the cosy city, visited the Blue Lagoon and the currently erupting vulcano.
		</p>
		<h3>Hiking the Laugavegur and Fimmv&#246;r&eth;uha&#769;ls trails</h3>
		<p>
			On July 29, we landed in the evening in Reykjavi&#769;k and put up our tents on the <a href="https://www.reykjavikcampsite.is">Reykjavik Campsite</a>. At the dawn of the next day, we took the bus to the first hut, Landmannalaugar. Despite the fact that we easily could start the hike, we camped here for a day, which allowed for an impressive evening walk on a <em>green-ish</em> mountain. My iPhone camera did not really capture the color as it actually was. It was so incredibly green/turquoise, very remarkable!

	  <div class="clearfix"></div>
		<p>
			On top of the green ridge we had a marvelous view over a lava field that we would pass through the next day, during our first official hiking day. Even though we did not even start the trail yet, we already had a great time!
		</p>
		<h4>Landmannalaugar &rarr; Hrafntinnusker (~12 km)</h4>
		<p>
			This was the first day of the 80km trail that would take us eventually to Sko&#769;gar. It started with a path through the impressive lava field we overlooked the evening before, and we quickly walked into the so-called rainbow mountains or rhyolite mountains. Since Iceland is basically one big vulcano, walked through a lot of active geothermal areas, accompanied by the stinging rotten-egg smell (sulphur) that was hissing, boiling and smoking out of the ground.

		</div>
	  <div class="clearfix"></div>
	  <p>
	  	As we climbed higher, the rhyolite mountains were left behind and the scenery went from colorful to grayscale. We walked across snowfields that were resting on black, vulcanic rock. The fog, which was getting thicker the higher we came, made this part of the trail kind of desolate, which actually contributed to the diversity of the (holi)day. When we arrived at the Hrafntinnusker hut, the fog was so thick, we could not even see the campsite, which was about 50m away from the hut!

			</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="clearfix"></div>
	  <p>
	  	After setting up our tents and having some dinner, we wanted to do an evening hike (as if we didn't hike enough...). Some enthousiastic Americans told us to visit the ice caves, which was only a 1 hour hike from the hut and super cool. So, with the fog still thick (visibility of about ~20-30m), we started the trail to the ice caves. After a while, we came to a snowfield with a slight gradient down and this would be the correct way to the ice caves. We didn't see anything else but snow, but we thought; "Ah, we can only see for about 30m, so there will be a marking pole after about 60m or so", hence we started decending the snowfield. After 5 minutes, nothing but snow, after 10, 15, 20 minutes, nothing but snow and fog around us. We only knew what was up and down! After rethinking all the bad things we did in our lives, we finally saw "land", and soon after the impressive ice caves. It was a nice evening hike, but a bit scary as well!

	  <div class="clearfix"></div>
	  <p>
	  	After returning safely at the campsite, we immediately jumped into our sleeping bags to physically prepare for the next day. Luckily we have good sleeping bags, as the temperature dropped significantly during the night (I did not measure it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was around 1&#176;C that night).
	  </p>
	  <h4>Hrafntinnusker &rarr; A&#769;lftavatn (~12 km)</h4>
	  <p>
	  	When we woke up in our tents the fog had cleared an the view was magnificent; we finally saw where we were camping. As you can see on the map, this part of the trail first climbs upto around 1300m, and then descents to around 500m. Right after we left, it started raining, and it kept raining until we were past the highest point of the trail. These circumstances made this trail the most difficult one of the Laugavegur trail.

	  <div class="clearfix"></div>
	  <p>
	  	At the top, or at least after a long climb, we made coffee. The rain stopped when we finished our coffee with this beautiful view! We entered a rainbow-mountain-rich area again as we progressed towards A&#769;lftavatn, crossing multiple geothermal areas. We needed to watch out step, actually, because the rain made the trail quite muddy. The more we decended the greener the scenery became. The rocks and clay traded for gravel and moss.

	  <p>
	  	A&#769;lftavatn has a beautiful lakeside location and this lake could already be seen from way up the mountain. It is always nice to see where you're heading (even though you see it is still quite far away). After crossing a river on foot (it was about calf-deep, but still very cold), we arrived at the hut. This time we did not do an extensive evening walk, we were all too tired and went to bed quite quickly. 
	  </p>
	  <h4>A&#769;lftavatn &rarr; Emstrur (~15 km)</h4>
	  <p>
	  	Fresh, after a good night of sleep we departed to Emstrur with good spirit. The trail did not involve as much climbing and descending as the previous two days, which was nice. The trail started with a green and mossy hike and quite immediate a river crossing. When after ~4km we arrived at the next hut on the Laugavegur (Hvanngil), we made our morning coffee. We continued our way to Emstrur and entered the Iceland Highland Desert (I it gave this name).

			</div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="clearfix"></div>
	  <p>
	  	The Iceland Highland Desert is an area covered in vulcanic black sand, here and there a lonely mountain, but mostly plain fields. It feels like you are walking on yet another country or planet. This part is again so significantly different than the rest. We were lucky that it was not that windy, as strong winds can cause sandstorms, which is not so nice of course. Someone, I cannot remember who, told me that there used to be glaciers here, which formed these lonely mountains and plain fields (I believed him/her). 
	  	<br/>
	  	The black, desert lands lead us to the Emstrur hut, which laid next to a picturesque stream. For this whole day we had very nice hiking weather, and this luckily continued in the evening. After putting up our tents and a nice adventure-food dinner, we went for a stroll. We tried to follow a route that was set out. Our first try did not work out, as we got stuck in some mossy field, and everyone knows that the moss in Iceland is sacred. Hence, we started our second try, which after about 30 minutes again seem to end up at nothing. Luckily, we saw some people in the distance and thought; well, there should be a path. I am very glad we saw those people, because we ended up on the edge of the Markarfljo&#769;tsgljuo&#769;fur canyon. A incredibly beautiful canyon, which is extremely deep and immensely colorful. You can see that I was and am very impressed. This was such an amazing experience! Definitely the most beautiful evening walk of the whole hiking tour!

	  <h4>Emstrur &rarr; &THORN;o&#769;rsm&#246;rk (~16 km)</h4>
	  <p>
	  	This day is the last day of the Laugavegur trail. We planned a resting day in &THORN;o&#769;rsm&#246;rk, so we need to take in as much of the Laugavur trail, now that it is still possible. The hike starts off with an infomation sign that explains how the Markarfljo&#769;tsgljuo&#769;fur canyon is formed and that such a canyon can form again quite easy, since we are facing the glacier covered Katla vulcano (currently sleeping). Appartently, when the vulcano erupts, the flood resulting from the melting glaciers is comparable to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katla_(volcano)#Geography_and_physical_appearances">combined average discharge of the Amazon, Mississippi, Nile, and Yangtze rivers</a>(!!!!). Let's continue walking please...
	  	<br/>
	  	The trail led us over a small brigde that allowed us to cross a narrow part of the Markarfljo&#769;tsgljuo&#769;fur canyon, and continues in a glooming landscape that became greener every step. On this day we could clearly see what was ahead of us in the upcoming days, since we were walking straight towards the glaciers 'Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull' and 'My&#769;rdalsj&#246;kull'. The Fimmv&#246;r&eth;uha&#769;ls trail lies between these two glaciers. The trail is not difficult in terms of elevation, but the length and the fact that we are almost at our resting destination makes that this part of the trail still feels heavy. Just before we hike more or less out of the wilderniss we need to cross an ice cold and quite deep river.

	  <p>
	  	Finally, we arrive at an information that allows us to choose between two huts. To make the choice easy, they put the available facilities on the placard for both huts. Hut 1 had the standard facilities, let say 5 facilities. Hut number 2 had the standard facilities, plus: a hot pool, steam cabin, buffet, kitchen, shop, and some more I cannot recall. The list was 3-4 times as long! We obviously choose Hut 2 (<a href="https://volcanotrails.com/volcano-huts/thorsmork/">Vulcano Huts</a>). That night, I enjoyed freshly cooked food as I have never enjoyed before; it was an all-you-can-eat buffet, and well... I did. We enjoyed some beers, good food, played some games, went to the steam cabin, into the hot pool (which was not that hot, by the way), we even met some fellow dutchies! That evening, we went to bed very peacefully and had an awesome night of sleep.

	  </div>
	  <div class="clearfix"></div>
	  <p>
	  	The next day was our resting day, and we mostly just rearranged our backpacks, went into the hot pool or steam cabin or played some games. We also went for a small hike, which resulted in a marvelous view over the whole &THORN;o&#769;rsm&#246;rk area. The next day, we would start the Fimmv&#246;r&eth;uha&#769;ls trail, and due to the uncertain weather conditions it was a possibility that we needed to hike the full trail (30km) in one go. Therefore, we took it slow and mainly prepared for the next day (so, no beers that evening).
	  </p>
	  <h4>&THORN;o&#769;rsm&#246;rk &rarr; Sko&#769;gar (~30 km)</h4>
	  <p>
	  	We left early in the morning
