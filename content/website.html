<h2>Building this website (from scratch)</h2>
<p class="pdate">September 2025</p>
<section>
	<p>
		I had the wish of having a personal website for quite a while. This meant however that I needed to think about a few things:
		<ul>
			<li>A domain-name,</li>
			<li>How to create the website,</li>
			<li>Things like hosting etc.,</li>
			<li>Which content it will have,</li>
			<li>Creating actual content.</li>
		</ul>
		The first item was quite easy. I saw that chrisverhoek.com and chrisverhoek.nl were still available and there was a discount at the time with <a href="https://www.transip.nl" target="_blank">transip.nl</a>. So, I had the domain... now the first thing to do was to start...
	</p>
	<h3>Starting</h3>
	<p>
		Just as with most things, this is the most difficult part. (Just as the writing of this post, for which the finishing date is <i>much</i> later than the date I started writing). I know I did not want to have a Wordpress-like website, as the flexibility is often limited there (or you probably pay a lot). Furthermore, I did not want a fancy-pancy website either way, plus most websites that have dynamic/interacting elements require a server that hosts the website. As I do not have a server, and I did not want to pay a monthly fee to host something I don't need anyway, I looked for so-called static websites.
	</p>
	<h4>Researching time</h4>
	<p>
		After some Google searches and some YouTube videos<sup><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Kz5P-mYdMgAJDmRJquyMHfdaIOD-3oj" target="_blank">I used this playlist</a></sup>, I found that there exist static website builders. This is a software framework that uses an XML-file and a collection of Markdown documents as input to generate a quasi-dynamic static website for you, which you can host using free services. It is actually rather simple and easy to use, and a <i>lot</i> of professional site builders make use of this framework. The building frameworks that I came across are "<a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">HUGO</a>" and "<a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a>", but there probably exist a lot more. Once you generated your website using one of these frameworks, you can deploy it and hence host it for free via services as <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">netlify</a>. This all seemed rather convenient.
	</p>
	<h4>Initial progress</h4>
	<p>
		With this gathered knowledge I started with a lot of enthusiasm. I choose some templates I liked from the HUGO website and started tweaking them to my liking. However, after playing with it for a while, there were still some things I did not like. And I did not know enough of the frameworks themself to adjust them to my needs (and I also did not have the time to learn this). So, I was at a crossroad. Shall I settle for a template I do not like 100%? Or shall I build my own website myself, from scratch, with the HTML-knowledge I have/had from high-school?
	</p>
	<p>
		I found that the one and only ultimate challenge was to make my own website in HTML and CSS from scratch.
	</p>
	<h3>Building an HTML website</h3>
	<p>
		Once I made the decision to do this, the feeling of regret already started to creep upon me. Luckily, one of my best friends got to the same challenge as I have now a few years ago (although, he is an IT'er, so not so much of a challenge). So, this allowed me to have a starting point and take some inspiration from his website (currently offline again). So, with an index.html and style.css-file the adventure began.
	</p>
	<h4>Getting something online</h4>
	<p>
		Next to having the website built in HTML, I also needed to get it somehow online. I quickly figured that you could use GitHub with GitHub Pages to host your static website (for free) without too much trouble. This made the whole process even nicer, as I could just modify and test the website locally and push it to the GitHub repository when I was satisfied. GitHub Pages itself then accounted for the 'putting-it-online' part of the process. Therefore, I made a small <a href="websiteblog/initialmessage.html" target="_blank">under-construction-page</a> to put online, which looked like this:
	</p>
	<figure>

		<figcaption>--- Under-construction page, which you can revisit <a href="websiteblog/initialmessage.html" target="_blank">here</a> ---</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		I used the Dutch company <a href="https://transip.nl">TransIP</a> to manage the domain. I'm writing this blog a long time after I first set it up, but I remember that it required some time and effort to set up the linking between the TransIP domain and GitHub Pages. But, after several YouTube and StackExchange visits I managed to get it working for both my chrisverhoek.nl and chrisverhoek.com domain. (And I never touched it again). So, with the under-construction-page available to the world, I could start building.
	</p>
	<h4>Setting up a framework</h4>
	<p>
		If you look into the HTML code of any website (using the "Inspect element" option), almost every element is a 'div' block. However, this is not how the HTML coding language was originally designed. The language allows for building highly structured websites, with a '<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>' that contains a '<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>', '<code>&lt;main&gt;</code>', and '<code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>'. The '<code>&lt;main&gt;</code>' on itself may contain one or more '<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>' blocks, and these '<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>' blocks contain different '<code>&lt;section&gt;</code>' blocks. The lowest hierarchical layer are the paragraph blocks '<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>'. This was something I could work with, and, purist as I am, I was going to use HTML as it was intended.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few evenings of work, I managed to get everything working, and got a basic website, which was essentially rather empty, but fast, working, and (most important) pure HTML and CSS. I was happy. The trouble started when I wanted to make updates and major changes.
	</p>
	<h3>Building a builder</h3>
	<p>
		One major downside about working <i>only</i> in HTML and having several pages with the same style, changing a detail in, for example the footer, requires changing the footer for <i>every</i> page. As I made my website more elaborate, I became more and more annoyed upto the point that I hacked a builder together in Python.
	</p>
	<p>
		This was one of those projects where I wanted to minimize effort and maximize reuse. Hence, together with my new friend ChatGPT, I <i>vibe</i>-coded <a href="https://github.com/seaveredge/Website-builder" target="_blank">this website builder</a> together. 
	</p>
	<h4>The hacky Python builder...</h4>
	<p>
		The website builder is built in Python (I considered Matlab for a minute, but my friend knows probably more about Python + HTML than Matlab + HTML. Just kidding, Matlab would be a nightmare, haha). The builder works as follows. Using <a href="https://github.com/seaveredge/Website-builder/blob/main/main.py#L134" target="_blank">the <code>Body</code> class</a>, which is part of the general <a href="https://github.com/seaveredge/Website-builder/blob/main/main.py#L26" target="_blank"><code></code>html_template</code></a> class, it creates a template webpage (i.e., a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>), such as this one or my <a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com" target="_blank">research page</a>, with only a <code>header</code>, an empty <code>main</code>, and a <code>footer</code>. These header, main, and footer templates are defined as template blocks, see the <a href="https://github.com/seaveredge/Website-builder/tree/main/blocks" target="_blank">folder</a> where these are stored. In these blocks, I defined so-called, <i>identifiers</i> that are indicated with '&#36;&#36;&#36;'. The template page, which is an object in the <code>Body</code> class, is then filled up with different articles, such as this one.
	</p>
	<p>
		When all the articles are added (each using the <code>.add_html_article()</code> function), the <code>index.html</code> page is generated with the <code>make_index_file()</code> function. The index file is the main html page, i.e., the 'official' webpage of the research landing page is <code>https://research.chrisverhoek.com/index.html</code>. The <code>make_index_file()</code> function substitutes <code>&#36;&#36;&#36;IDENTIFIERS&#36;&#36;&#36;</code> with the correct information, such that the links are correct, and every page will use the same header, body, and footer style.
	</p>
	<h4>References</h4>
	<p>
		Another problem that I faced in writing the HTML code by hand is writing my list of publications. I'm already very happy that in LaTeX, the <code>bibtex</code> package will make sure the formatting of the references is according to <i>the rules</i>. Every time I finished a preprint or when a paper got accepted, I needed to look up the correct formatting style for the particular reference. This should be easier...
	</p>
	<p>
		Luckily, I was not the only one who dreamt about having a <code>.bib</code> file parser in Python. Michael Weiss made the fantastic Python package <a href="https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser" target="_blank"><code>bibtexparser</code></a>, which allowed me to load in a bibdesk file and extract the different entries. Then, as you do, I hacked together a Python script together that synthesized a list of references. I made it such that the list of publications is ordered by type, then year, then order of authors (myself first, of course ;-)). I also set my own name in bold face. If I want to make changes, then I simply modify the bib-file and run the <code>synthesize_refs.py</code> script (which automatically runs when I run the main script). With this last hacky functionality hacked into my hacky builder, I consider it fairly done. This meant of course that I should really try to complete this blog (3 years later than planned). 
	</p>
	<h4>Future work</h4>
	<p>
		I initially started the website-builder project to add functionality that would allow for loading in Markdown files as articles. I might do that in the future, but so far I'm quite ok with typing these type of blogs in HTML. If I will start this adventure, I will probably give a small update here. But that will take many years (as completing this blog did). Currently it is managable.
	</p>
	<h4>A final judgement</h4>
	<p>
		Let me now try to answer the most important question... Is it useful? My answer to that is <i>yes-ish</i>. It solves two of my wishes: 1. it is purely HTML, which I find somehow very satisfying, and 2. it is fairly easy to use (for me). The second most important question, and actually maybe the most important for the reader: Is it usable for people not named Chris Verhoek? Well... I'm not sure. Probably. But, if you want to just have a website, it is much better to check out the dedicated website builders such as "<a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">HUGO</a>" or "<a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a>". If you are stubborn, however, feel free to spam me with questions on how to use it.

		If you made it this far, I sincerely thank you for reading this blog. I hope you enjoyed it!
