	<h2>Building this website (from scratch)</h2>
	<p class="pdate">September 2022</p>
	<section>
		<p>
			I had the wish of having a personal website for quite a while. This meant however that I needed to think about a few things:
			<ul>
				<li>A domain-name,</li>
				<li>How to create the website,</li>
				<li>Things like hosting etc.,</li>
				<li>Which content it will have,</li>
				<li>Creating actual content.</li>
			</ul>
			The first item was quite easy. I saw that chrisverhoek.com and chrisverhoek.nl were still available and there was a discount at the time with <a href="https://www.transip.nl" target="_blank">transip.nl</a>. So, I had the domain... now the first thing to do was to start...
		</p>
		<h3>Starting</h3>
		<p>
			Just as with most things, this is the most difficult part. (Just as the writing of this post, for which the finishing date is <i>much</i> later than the date I started writing). I know I did not want to have a Wordpress-like website, as the flexibility is often limited there (or you probably pay a lot). Furthermore, I did not want a fancy-pancy website either way, plus most websites that have dynamic/interacting elements require a server that hosts the website. As I do not have a server, and I did not want to pay a monthly fee to host something I don't need anyway, I looked for so-called static websites.
		</p>
		<h4>Researching time</h4>
		<p>
			After some Google searches and some YouTube videos<sup><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Kz5P-mYdMgAJDmRJquyMHfdaIOD-3oj" target="_blank">I used this playlist</a></sup>, I found that there exist static website builders. This is a software framework that uses an XML-file and a collection of Markdown documents as input to generate a quasi-dynamic static website for you, which you can host using free services. It is actually rather simple and easy to use, and a <i>lot</i> of professional site builders make use of this framework. The building frameworks that I came across are "<a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">HUGO</a>" and "<a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">jekyll</a>", but there probably exist a lot more. Once you generated your website using one of these frameworks, you can deploy it and hence host it for free via services as <a href="https://www.netlify.com" target="_blank">netlify</a>. This all seemed rather convenient.
		</p>
		<h4>Initial progress</h4>
		<p>
			With this gathered knowledge I started with a lot of enthusiasm. I choose some templates I liked from the HUGO website and started tweaking them to my liking. However, after playing with it for a while, there were still some things I did not like. And I did not know enough of the frameworks themself to adjust them to my needs (and I also did not have the time to learn this). So, I was at a crossroad. Shall I settle for a template I do not like 100%? Or shall I build my own website myself, from scratch, with the HTML-knowledge I have/had from high-school?
		</p>
		<p>
			I found that the one and only ultimate challenge was to make my own website in HTML and CSS from scratch.
		</p>
		<h3>Building an HTML website</h3>
		<p>
			Once I made the decision to do this, the feeling of regret already started to creep upon me. Luckily, one of my best friends got to the same challenge as I have now a few years ago (although, he is an IT'er, so not so much of a challenge). So, this allowed me to have a starting point and take some inspiration from his website (currently offline again). So, with an index.html and style.css-file the adventure began.
		</p>
		<h4>Getting something online</h4>
		<p>
			Next to having the website built in HTML, I also needed to get it somehow online. I quickly figured that you could use GitHub with GitHub Pages to host your static website (for free) without too much trouble. This made the whole process even nicer, as I could just modify and test the website locally and push it to the GitHub repository when I was satisfied. GitHub Pages itself then accounted for the 'putting-it-online' part of the process. Therefore, I made a small <a href="content/websiteblog/initialmessage.html" target="_blank">under-construction-page</a> to put online, which looked like this:
		</p>
		<figure>
  			<img src="content/websiteblog/underconstruction.png" alt="under-construction-page" style="width:70%;border: 1px solid #555">
  			<figcaption>--- Under-construction page, which you can revisit <a href="content/websiteblog/initialmessage.html" target="_blank">here</a> ---</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The downside of procrastinating is that you forget how you got this all working... To be continued...
